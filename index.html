          Instructions Preheat oven to 400℉. Place potatoes on a large rimmed
          baking sheet. You may line the pan with parchment paper if desired
          although it’s not necessary. Toss with olive oil. Season with fine
          salt. Roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until tender and starting
          to turn golden brown. Total cook time will vary depending on the size
          of the potatoes you use. Top with flakey salt and serve immediately.
